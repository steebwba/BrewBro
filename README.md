# Brew Bro

So, after makethetea.com was ripped from our lives, me and my colleagues didn't have a way of enforcing our tea/coffee making duties.
Enter - Brew Bro. The tea/coffee making randomiser-type-thing!

Currently in Alpha state, there are still items to be implemented such as:
* A logout button...
* Group Deletion
* User Edit
* 'Holiday Mode' - A system where a user can set a period they are not available to be selected
* 'Teabagging' - A flag/penalty system when a user is a repeat-offender for not brewing when picked
* Robust user authentication
* Email template
* and more!
